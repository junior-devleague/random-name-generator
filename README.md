# Random Name Generator

### How To Use

* Inside of the `students` directory, create a file containing the names of your students. See `studentListExample.js` as a template to create your own file.
  <br/>
* In your terminal use the command `node app.js` to display a random students name.
  <br/>
* If using generator for multiple schools, change `line 1 and line 8` in `app.js` to the correct student list.
